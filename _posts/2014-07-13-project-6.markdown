description: '“Voice of Nature” is a piece of experimental electronic music that I composed and produced with Ableton Live. By using samples of places suffering from climate changes such as melting glaciers and diminishing rainforests, and warping and editing them in Live's Simpler, I was able to design a handful of unique timbres (for instance, the synth chord sound that lasts throughout the piece) and showcase the beauty and mystery of nature. In the making of their arrangement, I applied MIDI effects such as MPE control and Microtuner in order to create dedicate tune changes, and wrote polytonal melodies and polyrhythm beats (inspired by the music genre named Math Rock) to enrich the auditory color. At the end of this song, I combined some Neuro Hop style basslines with several samples recorded under the sea to create a dark and mysterious atmosphere. “Voice of Nature” is created aiming to raise our awareness of protecting the environment, and reminding us of the special, pictorial beauty of the world.
