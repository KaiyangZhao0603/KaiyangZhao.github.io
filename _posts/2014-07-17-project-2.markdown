description: This gesture-controlled instrument is designed with Max/MSP/Jitter, Max external package cv.jit, and software synthesizer Serum.

Thus, the ultimate principle of this design is to keep every operation as easy as possible (<a href="https://youtu.be/zId0vE_OMhE">Demonstration Video(Part 2)</a> / <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QhDPd_me1dxBbLhvE4_D6w-9xDY7pOF9/view?usp=sharing">Introduction Document(Part 2)</a>).
