description: '<a href="https://maxforlive.com/library/device/8474/chordmaker">ChordMaker</a> is my original MIDI effect plugin that can match diatonic seven chords to melody notes in real time. It supports selecting from 24 different natural minor/major scales, customizing the number of melody notes (up to 16), and matching chords at a certain sequence (some will be matched but some won’t). Users can also select the type of every chord (For example minor/major, dominant, and half-diminished chords). In order to improve user experience, I also designed an automated reset module and a lag module for every chord note to simulate the effect of a real person’s playing.(<a href="https://youtu.be/n4WbbN9dcpQ">Demonstration Video(Part 2)</a> / <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8KEJTQKnkThMZUUEPSMl6Gj_geIevxn/view?usp=share_link">Introduction Document</a>)'
