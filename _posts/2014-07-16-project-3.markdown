description: '<a href="https://maxforlive.com/library/device/8449/wavetide">WaveTide</a> is a polyphonic virtual granular synthesizer designed and developed entirely by me, using Max for Live. It divides a sample into small grains then rearranges and loops it to synthesize new sounds. Itâ€™s a powerful polyphonic synth that supports playing up to 16 notes at once. It has basically all the functions of those mainstream granular synthesizers on the market, as well as its own comparative advantages. For example, WaveTide supports adjusting the amplitude of the grains in detail and selecting a range that can randomly generate the start points and durations of the grains. By the way, all three selecting tools on the left are corresponded, and thus can be either visual or precise. The expanded function area on the right is presented in a visual and interactive way, and most of the parameters in this device can be automated. This endows users more freedom to create new timbres and sound effects.(<a href="https://youtu.be/n4WbbN9dcpQ">Demonstration Video</a> / <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AdAz6JbAXNep23ewWcWHkTdwQ21SGmoW/view?usp=sharing">Introduction Document</a>)'
